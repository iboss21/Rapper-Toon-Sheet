# Rapper-Toon-Sheet
User uploads 1–2 photos (front face, optional full-body). The app generates a consistent stylized cartoon-realism character reference sheet: front/side/3/4 headshots + full-body front/side/back turnarounds + 1–2 action poses (e.g., holding keys, sitting in car). It must preserve facial identity from the uploaded photo(s).
